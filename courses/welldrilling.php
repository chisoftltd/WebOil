                                <p> The time required to plan and execute a well construction programme is
                                    dependent on many variables including sub-surface complexity, location and type
                                    of well. For any well, however, there are common activities which must be
                                    addressed to enable comprehensive planning and operational control. For the
                                    purposes of this topic we will assume a single well, drilled from a semisubmersible
                                    rig. The main activities are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Receipt of well planning request / well objectives;</li>
                                    <li>Allocation of engineering / operational resources;</li>
                                    <li>Review of special considerations (licence requirements, physical
                                        restrictions);
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Well design;</li>
                                    <li>Government/legislative requirements;</li>
                                    <li>Sourcing of materials and services including rig;</li>
                                    <li>Site survey;</li>

                                    <li>Risk identification and mitigation;</li>
                                    <li>Time /cost generation;</li>
                                    <li>Pre-operational review;</li>

                                <p>While it would be ideal if the activities shown above could be laid out in an
                                    ordered sequence it is more often the case that many of the activities occur in
                                    parallel. Also it is common for plans to evolve and change as operational
                                    definition is refined. In particular the generation of the time/cost estimate does
                                    not tend to be a one off event. Invariably costs are required at an early stage
                                    where little detailed planning or review has been performed. Hence accuracy of
                                    the estimate develops throughout the planning phase and different classes of
                                    estimate are often provided dependent on position on the planning/execution
                                    timeline.</p>

                                    and what deliverables might be expected.
